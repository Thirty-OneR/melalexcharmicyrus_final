05/07/2020: Group meeting to start on a hierarchical model. Tentatively decided that a quadratic rise and a quadratic fall would offer more flexibility for fitting for our very different objects. 

05/06/2020: Group meeting to discuss model parameters and action items for today. Deciding on a squared exponential kernel as noted in Scalzo 2014. Mean model may contain parameters for a quadratic fit in rise, a linear fit in decline, and a peak magnitude. SALT2 parameters are "stretch" (x1) of the lightcurve, peak, and color. Tonight we will each get a mean model and GP for a single band. Tomorrow we will meet to do the hierarchical model for all bands per object.


05/05/2020: Group meeting to start talking about potential models and review literature. Main current question is what dimensions (1 or 2) we want the model to be in. Today we will continue doing background research on our own and meet again tomorrow to begin coding the model.


05/04/2020: Group meeting to allocate tasks and select objects for analysis. We'll make the GP model together, then separately run and interpret it for each of our objects. The events we've chosen:

Alex   - 2020oi
Mel    - LSQ12gdj
Charmi - 1987A
Cyrus  - 2011fe


We're going to meet before class tomorrow (12pm CT) to review papers and begin coding.
